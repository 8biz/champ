## FOREWORD

## FOREWORD




Wrestling, like all other sports, obeys Rules that constitute the "Rules of the Game" and define its practice,
the aim of which is to "pin" the opponent or to win on points.

Greco-Roman and Freestyle wrestling basically differ as follows:

In Greco-Roman Wrestling, it is strictly forbidden to grasp the opponent below the belt line, or to trip him or
to use the legs actively on his opponent to perform any action.

In Freestyle Wrestling and in Women’s Wrestling, however, it is permissible to grasp the legs of the opponent,
to trip him/her and to use the legs actively to perform any action. Women’s Wrestling follows the rules of
Freestyle Wrestling, forbidding however the Double Nelsons.

Beach  Wrestling,  Pankration,  Belt  Wrestling,  Grappling  and  Traditional  Wrestling  are  subject  to  specific
regulations.

Frequently modified and always subject to further modification, the Rules set forth herein must be known
and accepted by all wrestlers, coaches, referees and leaders. They call upon those who practice the sport
to fight totally and universally, with complete honesty and fair play for the pleasure of the spectators.

## GENERAL RULES


## Article 1 –  Object

Drawn up in compliance with the UWW Constitution, the Financial Regulations, the Disciplinary Regulations,
the General Rules governing the organization of international competitions, and all the specific Regulations,
the International Wrestling Rules have as their specific objectives to:

- Define and specify the practical and technical conditions under which bouts are to take place;
- Determine the competition system, methods of victory, defeat, classification, penalty, elimination
of competitors, etc;
- Determine the values to be assigned to wrestling actions and holds;
- List situations and prohibitions;
- Determine the technical functions of the officials.

Being subject to modification in light of practical observations as to their application and research into their
effectiveness,  the  international  Rules  set  forth  in  the  following  document  constitute  the  framework  within
which the sport of wrestling is conducted in all its styles.


## Article 2 –  Interpretation

In the event of disagreement as to the interpretation of the provisions of any article in the following Rules, the
Executive Committee of UWW is solely empowered to determine the exact meaning of the article(s) in question.
The English text shall prevail.


## Article 3 – Application

Application of these Rules to the Olympic Games, Championships, and to all international competitions under
the control of UWW is compulsory (All the events registered on the United World Wrestling Calendar).

During  international  tournaments,  a  competition  procedure  that  differs  from  that  set  out  in  the  Rules  may
exceptionally be used, provided that permission has been granted by UWW and all participating countries.



## CHAPTER 1 – MATERIAL STRUCTURE


## Article 4 –  The Mat

A  new  UWW  approved  mat,  with  a  9m  diameter  and  surrounded  by  a  1.50m  border  of  the  same  thickness  is
obligatory  in  the  following  contests:  Olympic  Games,  Championships  and  Cups.  For  all  other  international
competitions, mats must be homologated, but not necessarily new.

For the Olympic Games and World Championships, warm up and training mats must also be new and approved
by UWW and be of the same quality as the competition mats.

An orange band of 1m wide and forming an integral part of the wrestling area is drawn along the circumference
on the inside of the circle of 9m in diameter.






## 5

The following terms will be used to designate the various parts of the mat:



The central circle indicates the middle of the mat (1m of diameter). The inside part of the mat which is inside
the orange circle is the central surface of wrestling (7m of diameter). The passivity zone (orange strip)  is 1m
wide. The protection area is 1m50 wide.

For  all  Olympic  Games,  World  and  Continental  Championships  and  Ranking  Series  events,  the  mat  shall  be
installed on a platform not higher than 1m10 or lower than 0m80. The platform around each side of the mat
must reach 1 meter minimum. If more than one mat is used, 1 meter minimum should separate each mat. In all
cases, the color of the protection area will have to be different from the one of the mat. The wooden floor near
the mat will have to be covered with a strongly well-fixed soft cover. For safety reasons, the scoreboards should
be placed on a separate platform, close to the mat(s).

To prevent contamination, the mat must be cleaned and disinfected before every wrestling session. When mats
that have a smooth, uniform and non-abrasive surface are used (canvas included), the same hygienic measures
must also be applied.

A circle must be traced in the middle of the mat with an inside diameter of one meter and a surrounding band
10 cm wide.

The coach of each athlete will be located on the same side of the mat. The red wrestler will be placed on the
left and the blue wrestler on the right.

The mat should be installed so that it is surrounded by a wide open space in order to ensure that the competition
proceeds normally.

All the details regarding the UWW logo and the mat manufacturer logo, should be addressed to United World
Wrestling headquarters and be followed by the guidelines sent to the Mat Producers.






## 6

## Article 5 –  The Uniform

To participate in United World Wrestling events, athletes of ALL age categories must comply with the UWW
Uniform Regulations. These Regulations are intended to allow innovative design features in conformity with
the rules and regulations for wrestling.

Responsibility of compliance

At all events organized by United World Wrestling, the National Federations are responsible; and at Olympic
Games  the  National  Olympic  Committees  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  items  worn  or  used  by  the
members of their delegation comply with the terms of these rules.

## General Considerations

The singlet is the standard uniform which is used across all Olympic styles.

The wrestling singlet must be made up of a smooth fabric without any rough edges that does not present any
danger of irritation, neither for the user nor for the opponent.

The singlet must allow wrestlers complete freedom of movement to perform all holds and techniques safely
and effectively.

For  the  specific  information  regarding  Specific  Considerations,  Colors,  Markings,  Sponsor  Placement,  Ear
Protectors and Shoes please refer to the UWW Uniform Guideline document.

## Violations

At the weigh-in, the referee must check that each competitor satisfies the requirements of this article. The
wrestler must be warned at the weigh-in, if their appearance is non-compliant. If the wrestler fails to comply
the wrestlers’ federation will be fined at the conclusion of the competition. If the wrestler enters the mat with
the incorrect designated singlet for the match, officials will allow a    maximum of one minute in order for them
to comply. If, after this time, the wrestler is still at fault, they will lose the match by forfeit.

It is prohibited to:

- Wear the emblem or abbreviation of another country.
- Apply any greasy or sticky substance to the body
- Arrive at the mat perspiring for the beginning of the match and for the beginning of each period.
- Wear taping or bandages on fingers, wrists, arms or ankles that are not approved by the competition’s
doctor. These bandages must be covered with elastic straps.
- Wear any object that might cause injury to the opponent, such as rings, bracelets, prosthesis, piercing
etc.
- Wear under-wired bras


## Article 6 –  Competitor’s License

Any  male  or  female  U15,  U17,  U20,  U23, senior  and  veteran wrestler  who  competes  in  the  Olympic  Games,
World Championships, World Cups, Continental Championships, Cups and Games, Regional Games and the World
and Continental League, international tournaments registered in the UWW calendar must hold an international
competitor’s license, as defined by special Regulations.

This  license  is  also  used  as  insurance  for  medical  and  hospital  expenses  in  case  of  an  accident  taking  place
abroad during the international competition the wrestler is participating in.

The license is only valid for the current year and must be renewed each year.



## 7

The license request must be sent at least 2 months before the competition that the concerned wrestler will take
part in.  This timeline is fixed in order to let enough time to conclude the procedure and validate the license.



Article 7 –  Age, Weight and Competition Categories

Age categories

The age categories are as follows:

U15   14-15 years (from 13 in the year with medical and parental authorization*)
U17    16-17 years (from 15 in the year with medical and parental authorization*)
U20   18-20 years (from 17 in the year with medical and parental authorization*)
Seniors U 23                    19-23 years (from 18 in the year with medical and parental authorization*)
Seniors    20 years and older
Veterans   older than 35 years

- The medical and parental authorization is submitted in Athena via the Annual Medical Certificate & Wrestler’s Declaration
when purchasing the UWW License.

U20 Wrestlers are allowed to participate in the competitions for seniors, except for those who are 17 years old
in the concerned year.

For the Senior Under 23 years old Championships, the Senior rules and weight categories are used.

An honor certificate for each participant will be issued by the President of the National Federation attesting to
the age of the wrestler; this certificate must be drawn up in accordance with the model supplied by UWW, on
the National Federation’s letterhead.

A  wrestler  may  participate  in  a  competition  only  under  the  nationality  appearing  on  their license.  If,  at  any
time, it is determined by UWW that the statement was false and that fraud occurred, the disciplinary measures
provided for to this end will be immediately applied against the National Federation, the wrestler and the person
whose signature appears on the fraudulent certificate.

Wrestlers  who  wish  to  change  their  nationality  must  refer  to  the  procedure  described  in  the  International
Regulations for the change of nationality. Wrestlers can change their nationality only once. Once the procedure
for the change of nationality is completed they are not entitled to compete for their former country anymore
or for any other country in an official competition organized under the aegis of United World Wrestling.

Each licensed  wrestler  who  participates  in  a  competition  automatically  agrees  to  UWW  to  use  his  filmed  or
photographed image for the promotion of the competition or of competitions to come. If a wrestler refuses to
agree to these conditions, they will have to make this clear at the entry stage and, may therefore be excluded
from the competition.

## CHAPTER 2 – COMPETITIONS AND PROGRAMMES


## Article 8 –  Competition System

The competitions take place by direct elimination system with an ideal number of wrestlers, i.e. 4, 8, 16, 32,
64, etc. If there is no ideal number of wrestlers in a category, qualification matches will be organized.

Pairing is made in the order of the numbers drawn at random. All wrestlers who lost against both finalists will
have  repechage  matches.  There  are  two  separated  groups  of  repechage:  one  group  of  wrestlers  who  lost
against the finalist of the upper part of the bracket, and another group of wrestlers who lost against the finalist
from the bottom part of the bracket. The repechage matches begin with wrestlers who lost in the first round
including in qualification matches to obtain the ideal number against one of the two finalists up to the losers
in the semi-finals by direct elimination. The winners of the two repechage groups will receive each the bronze
medal.

Each  weight category  is  organized  in  two  days.    The  draw  takes  place  the  day  before  the  beginning of the
category concerned at the latest.



## 10

The  medical  control  and  a  first  weigh-in  will  be  held  the  morning  of  the  concerned  weight  category.  The
qualified athletes for the finals and repechages will be weigh-in again the second morning of the concerned
weight category. No more weight tolerance will be allowed for the second weigh-in.

2kg weight tolerance is allowed for World Cup, UWW Ranking Series Tournaments and for the International
## Tournaments.

For the competitions where less than 16 athletes are registered, the weight category can be organized in one
day. If   it is the case, the medical control and the weigh-in remain the morning of the competition and the
draw could be organized during the weigh-in.


The competition takes place in the following manner:

First day:
- Qualification rounds
- Elimination rounds

Second day:
- Repechage rounds
## - Finals


Classification criteria

From the 7th place, wrestlers of each category will be ranked depending on their classification points.

In  case  of  a  ranking  tie,  they  will  be  ranked  by  analyzing  the  following  criteria  successively,  across  the  all
competition:

- The most victories by “Fall”
- The most match won by superiority
- The most technical points scored
- The fewest technical points given
- The lowest seeds number (if applicable)
- The lowest draw number


Competition with less than 8 athletes (Nordic Tournament)

If less than 6 wrestlers are registered in one weight category, one group will be established and all wrestlers
will compete against each other. In a two day competition format, the last round will be organized the second
day. In this case, even the wrestlers who have no bout scheduled in the last round must successfully complete
the weigh-in on the second day.

Fo  r Continental and World Championships, a weight category that counts only 1 wrestler will be cancelled
and no title or medal will be awarded!

If there are 6 or 7 athletes in one weight category, the competition starts with a pool phase with two groups.

As mentioned above, all wrestler from each group will compete against all the other wrestlers of their group
(the Nordic tournament system is used as the ranking criterion within each group). Ranking within the groups
is used to determine the pairings for the semi-finals.

The semi-final matches will consist with:

- the first ranked in the group A against the second ranked in the group B
- the second ranked in the group A against the first ranked in the group B



## 11

The gold medal match will be between the winners of the semi-finals and the bronze medal match will be
between the losers of the semi-finals.

Only one bronze medal will be awarded for this scenario.

Ranking criteria for the Nordic tournament

In the Nordic tournament, the wrestler with the highest number of victories will be ranked first.

Within the same group, if two wrestlers have an equal number of victories, their direct match will determine
the ranking.

For all the other cases with a tie between athletes, the ranking will be determined following these criteria,
across the all competition:

- The highest classification points
- The highest victories by « Fall »
- The highest match victories by superiority
- The highest technical points scored
- The fewest technical points given
- The lowest seeds number (if applicable)
- The lowest draw number


## Article 9 –  Competition Programme

The duration of Olympic Games is 7 days on 3 mats.

The  duration  of  the  senior  World  Championships  is  9 days on  4  mats  and  the  duration  of  the  U20  World
Championships is 7   days on 4   mats. However, depending on the number of entries received, one mat can be
added or withdrawn for all competition types with UWW’s agreement.

In principle, for all competition types, the sessions shall not last longer than three hours.

Except the competitions televised by United World Wrestling, all the matches for the 1st and 2nd place must
occur on one mat. The matches for the 3
rd
and 5
th
place may occur on two mats.

For the competitions televised by United World Wrestling, all the finals (gold, bronze and bronze) must take
place on one mat in order that all the bouts are broadcasted.


## Article 10 – Award Ceremonies

The first four wrestlers in each weight category shall take part in the awards ceremony, and shall receive a
medal and a diploma, according to their ranking.

1st    Gold + diploma
2nd    Silver + diploma
The two 3rd              Bronze + diploma

At the World Championships, each Champion will receive the World Championship Belt.

Only one bronze medal will be awarded in the weight categories where the Nordic System is used.






## 12

## CHAPTER 3 – COMPETITION PROCEDURE


Article 11–  Weigh-In

For all competitions, the weigh-in is organized each morning of the concerned weight-category. The weigh-in
and the medical control lasts 30 minutes.

The second morning of the concerned weight category only the wrestlers who participate in the repechages
and finals have to come for the weigh-in. This weigh-in will last 15 minutes.

No  wrestler  may  be  accepted  at  the  weigh-in  if  they  have  not  undergone  a  medical  examination  the  first
morning.  Wrestlers  must  appear  at  the  medical  examination  and  the  weigh-in  with  their  license  and
accreditation.

The  only  uniform  allowed  for  the  weigh-in  is  the  correct singlet.  A fter  having  been  examined  by  qualified
physicians  who  are  obliged  to  eliminate  any  wrestler  who  presents  any  danger  of  contagious  disease,  the
wrestler can be weighed-in. No weight tolerance will be allowed for the singlet.

Contestants must be in perfect physical condition, with their fingernails cut very short.

Throughout the entire  weigh-in period, wrestlers have the right, each in turn, to get on the scale as many
times as they wish.

The referees responsible for the weigh-in must check that all wrestlers are of the weight corresponding to the
category in which they are entered for the competition, that they fulfil all the requirements of Article 5 and
to  inform  any  wrestler  of  the  risk  they  run  if  they  present themselves  on  the  mat  in  the incorrect  dress.
Referees will refuse to weigh a wrestler who is wearing an altered singlet.

The referees responsible for the weigh-in will receive the results of the draw and will be allowed to control
only the athletes who are on this list.

If an athlete does not attend or fail the weigh-in (the 1
st
or the 2
nd
weigh-in), they will be eliminated of the
competition and ranked last, without rank (Exception: cf. Article 55 – Medical Service Intervention).

If one (or more) athlete qualified for the repechages and/or finals doesn’t attend or fails the weigh-in, the
athlete(s)  (who  successfully  passed  the  second  weigh-in)  will  move  to  the  next  round  in  their part  of  the
bracket.*

*If  all  athletes  don’t  attend  or  fail  the  second  weigh-in,  the  ranking  will  be  made  according  the  individual
ranking criteria (Cf. Article 8).


Article 12 – Draw and Pairing

Participants shall be paired off according to the numerical order determined by the drawing of lots made the
day  before  the  competition  day  of  the  concerned  weight  category,  at  the  latest.  The  UWW  competition
management system shall be used for the draw and management of all international competitions entered in
the UWW calendar.

If the UWW competition management system cannot be used, numbered tokens must be enclosed in an urn, a
bag or any other similar object. If a different system is used, it has to be clearly announced.

Important: When the person responsible for the weigh-in and drawing of lots observes an error in the regulation
procedure as outlined above, the drawing of lots for the category in question has to be cancelled. Drawing of
lots for this category will then be repeated with the agreement of the technical delegate.



## 13

The technical delegate or the IT person is responsible of    the smooth running of the draw and must ensure that
these Rules were complied with. They will also confirm the weigh-in list. After the end of the draw, no protest
can be submitted.

Position of the athletes in the bracket

For a competition with 6 or 7 athletes, the wrestler who gets the lowest draw number will be in group A, then
the second lowest draw number will be in group B, then the third lowest draw number will be in group A and
so on.

For a competition with more than 7 athletes – If the number of athletes participating in a weight category
different  from  (more  than)  8, 16,  32,  etc,  qualification  rounds  must  be  organized.  To  provide  a  balance
between  the  upper  and  lower  part  of  the  bracket,  qualification  rounds’  position  follows  the  top-bottom,
bottom-top approach. The same approach is used to determine the Seeded athlete’s position on the bracket.

Seeded athlete into the Bracket

The aim of such drawing of lots is to place consequently the seeded athletes as far as possible from each other
in order to preserve them until the latest possible stage. The remaining positions (non-seeded athletes) are
filled up from top to bottom based on their draw number (a small draw number doesn’t preserve the athletes
to compete in the qualification round).

If  the  qualifications  matches  must  include  the  seeded  athletes,  the  pairing  starts  with  the  lowest  seeded
athlete.

Seeded athletes into a weight category with 6 or 7 athletes will be placed like that:

## Group A     Group B
Seeds n°1    Seeds n°2
Seeds n°4    Seeds n°3
Seeds n°5    Seeds n°6
Seeds n°7 (if applicable)

As soon as the seeded athlete is placed, the non-seeded athletes will be placed in the ABA approach.

All    the    different    brackets    – with    no    seed,    4    seeds    and    8    seeds    are    available    at:
https://uww.org/governance/regulations-olympic-wrestling


If one or several top seeds athlete(s) is not entered (replaced or not registered), the next top seed or the next
best athlete(s) in the Ranking will take his (their) place.


## Article 13 – Starting List

If  one  or  more  wrestlers  do  not  attend  or  fail  the weigh-in,  their  opponent(s) will  win  the  bout  by  forfeit.
These wrestlers will be eliminated from the competition and will be ranked last, without rank. NO pairing will
be made again on the day of the competition.



Article 14 – Elimination from the Competition

The loser is eliminated and ranked according to the classification points marked, except wrestlers who lost
against one of the finalists as they take part in the repechage for the 3rd or 5th places.

After the weigh-in, should a wrestler, without medical advice signed by the UWW doctor or the competition’s
doctor and without advising the competition secretariat, not present themselves to the opponent when their
name is called, the match will be lost by forfeit. The athlete will be eliminated and ranked without rank and
the opponent will be declared the winner of the match.


## 14


If the UWW doctors can prove that a wrestler simulates an injury for whatever reasons to avoid competing
against an opponent, they will be disqualified, placed last in the ranking, without any rank and the note “DSQ”
will be placed with their name.

If a wrestler commits an obvious offence against fair play within the spirit and concept of total and universal
wrestling enunciated by UWW, and openly cheats, commits a serious error or engages in brutality, they  will
be disqualified immediately from the competition and eliminated by a unanimous decision of the officiating
team. In this situation, the wrestler at fault will be placed last in the ranking, without any rank and the note
“DSQ” will be placed with their name.

If a wrestler engages in brutality after the conclusion of the match, he/she will be disqualified, placed last in
the ranking, without any rank and the note “DSQ” will be placed with their name.

If two wrestlers are disqualified for brutality during the same match, they will be eliminated as above. The
pairing for the following round will not be modified. The wrestler supposed to meet one of the disqualified
wrestlers wins the match by forfeit.

If two semi-finalists are disqualified for brutality or eliminated by forfeit during same match, their losers in
quarter-final will compete in semi-final and repechage group will be modified regarding result of this semi-
final match. If the Semi-Finals are organized during the evening session, this bout will be organized at the end
of the session in order to allow enough time for the concerned athletes to be prepared. If it happens on day
1, one hour (since this double disqualification/forfeit happens) will be given to these athletes to be prepared.

If a double injury (2VIN) happens during one match, the opponent of the next round will win the match by
injury. If it happens in a semi-final match and in order to determine which athletes have to go in the repechage,
we will use the classification criteria (Article 8) to determine the winner of this double injury match.

If a forfeit(s) or disqualification(s) happen during a medal match (1-2 or 3-5 ), the following wrestlers (from
the part of the bracket of the disqualified/forfeited athlete(s)) will move up the table to establish the final
classification. If the two finalists are disqualified, then it will be necessary to make the bout between the two
bronze medalists to determine the 1st and the 2nd place. All others participants will go up in the ranking, the
two in 5th position will become 3rd. If the two finalists are forfeits despite their successful second weigh-in,
the same process will apply (an additional match between the two bronze medalists).

For all type of forfeit, the concerned athlete will be ranked last, without rank.


Ranking in the event of doping violations

In case of positive doping control, the wrestler will be disqualified, and they will automatically be placed last
in the ranking, without any rank and the note “DSQ” will be placed with their name. The wrestlers ranked
after this individual will move up in the ranking. If the disqualified athlete was ranked in the 3
rd
place, the
wrestler from the same half of the bracket as the disqualified athlete will move up to take that position. In
that case, only one wrestler will be ranked in the 5
th
place.

If both athletes ranked first and second test positive during doping control and are disqualified; the two bronze
medalists will each be awarded a Gold medal. No silver medal will be awarded in this case. The two wrestlers
who originally placed 5
th
will move up to the 3
rd
places. All other competitors will advance accordingly, noting
that in this situation there will be only one wrestler ranked 5
th
## .

In the event of a positive doping control during a team event, the team from the athlete who committed the
violation will be disqualified and be placed last in the ranking, without any rank and the note “DSQ” will be
displayed next to the team’s flag.

## CHAPTER 4 – REFEREEING BODY


## Article 15– Composition

In all competitions, the refereeing body for each bout shall consist of the following:

- 1 mat chairman
- 1 referee
- 1 judge

The appointment procedures of these three officials are set in the Regulations for the International Refereeing
Body. Replacement of an official during a bout is strictly prohibited, except in the case of a serious illness that
is  medically  confirmed.  In  no  case  may  the  refereeing  body  be  composed  of  two  officials  of  the  same
nationality.  Furthermore,  it  is  strictly  forbidden  for  an  official  to  officiate  in  bouts  involving  compatriot
wrestlers.

The refereeing body shall make all decisions unanimously or by majority (two out of three) except in passivity,
caution and fall situations where the mat chairman’s approval must be obtained.


## Article 16 – General Duties

Officials shall perform all the duties set forth in the Regulations governing wrestling competitions and in any
special provisions which might be established for the organization of particular competitions.

It is the duty of officials to follow each bout very carefully and to evaluate the actions of the wrestlers so that
the results shown on the judge’s and mat chairman’s score sheet accurately reflect the specific nature of said
bout.

The  mat  chairman,  referee  and  judge  shall  each evaluate  the  holds  independently  before  reaching  a  final
decision. The referee and judge must work together under the direction of the mat chairman, who co-ordinates
the work of the officials.

It is the duty of the officials to assume all of the functions of refereeing and judging, to award points and to
impose the penalties stipulated in the Rules.

The score sheets of the judge and mat chairman are used to tally all the holds executed by the two opponents.
The points, cautions (0), passivity’s (P), the fall (points of the last action have to be surrounded), the last
point scored (underlined),  must  be  recorded  with  the  greatest  accuracy,  in  the  order  corresponding  to  the
various phases of the bout. These score sheets must be signed by the judge and mat chairman, respectively.

If a bout does not end in a “fall”, the decision shall be made by the mat chairman. It shall be based on an
evaluation  of  all  the  actions  of  each  competitor,  recorded  from  beginning  to  end  on  the  judge’s  and  mat
chairman’s score sheets.

All the points awarded by the judge must be announced to the public as soon as they are determined, either
by means of bats or by an electric scoreboard.

Officials  are  required  to  use  the  basic  UWW  vocabulary  that  is  appropriate  to  their  respective  roles  when
conducting the bouts. However, they are forbidden to speak to anybody during the bout, except, of course,
amongst  themselves  when  the  occasion  requires  them  to  do  so  for  consultation  and  to  perform  their  tasks
properly.

When  a  challenge  is  requested  by  a  coach  and  confirmed  by  the  wrestler,  the  refereeing  delegate  (or
substitute)  and  the  mat  chairman  must  watch  the  video  evidence  on  the  large  screen.  After  a  discussion


## 16

together,  the  refereeing  delegate  (or  substitute)  renders  its  decision  solely  without  consultation  with  the
refereeing body.


Article 17 – Referee’s uniform

The refereeing body (referees, judges and mat chairmen) must wear the UWW homologated Uniform.


## Article 18 – The Referee

a) The referee is responsible for the orderly conduct of the bout on the mat, which must be directed according
to the Rules.

b) They must  command  the  respect  of  the  contestants  and  exercise  full  authority  over  them  so  that  they
immediately  obey  orders  and  instructions.  Similarly,  they must  conduct  the  bout  without  tolerating  any
irregular and untimely outside interventions.

c)   They shall work in close co-operation with the judge and must carry out his duties in supervising the bout
while refraining from any impulsive or untimely interference. The referee whistle shall begin, interrupt and
end the bout.

d) The referee shall order the return of the wrestlers to the mat after they have left it, or the continuation of
the  bout  in  the  standing  or  "parterre"  position  (on  the  mat),  in  collaboration  with  the  judge  and  the  mat
chairman.

e) The referee is required to wear a red wristband on the left wrist, and a blue wristband on the right wrist.
They shall indicate with their fingers the points corresponding to the value of a hold after its execution (if it

etc.) by raising the arm corresponding to the wrestler who scored.

f) The referee must never hesitate to:

- Interrupt the bout at exactly the right time, neither too soon nor too late.
- Indicate whether a hold executed at the edge of the mat is valid.
- Signal a potential fall by raising their hand to seek agreement from the judge and the mat chairman.
Once the fall is confirmed by the mat chairman, the referee shall indicate the fall by striking the mat
with their raised hand and blowing the whistle to end the match.

g) The referee must:

- Rapidly and clearly order the position in which wrestling must be resumed, when he sends the wrestlers
back to the center of the mat.
- Not stand so close to the wrestlers that the mat chairman is obstructed, particularly if a fall appears
imminent.
- Ensure that the wrestlers do not rest during the bout on the pretense of wiping their bodies, blowing
their noses, pretending to be injured, etc. In this case, the referee must stop the bout and ask for a
caution (0) to the wrestler at fault and 1 point to his opponent.
- Be  able  to  change  their position  from  one  moment  to  the  next,  on  the  mat  or  around  it,  and  in
particular, immediately fall flat onto the stomach to obtain a better view of an imminent fall.
- Be able to stimulate a passive wrestler without interrupting the bout, by standing in such a way as to
prevent the wrestler from leaving the mat.
- Be ready to whistle if the wrestlers come too close to the edge of the mat.
- Not interrupt the bout in a danger position situation except if it is an illegal hold.
- Strictly prevent the wrestler from grasping or interlocking fingers with their opponent in a way that
restricts movement, avoids engagement, or prevents the execution of a hold. Interlocking fingers to
block attacks, delay action, or gain an unfair advantage is considered a negative or illegal maneuver
and must be penalized according to the rules.



## 17


h) The referee is also required to:

- Pay special attention to the wrestlers’ legs in Greco-Roman wrestling.
- Require the wrestlers to remain on the mat until the result of the bout is announced.
- In all cases where agreement is necessary, first ask the opinion of the judge at the edge of the mat
facing the mat chairman.
- Proclaim the winner after agreement with the mat chairman at the end of the bout.

i) The referee requests penalties for violation of the Rules or for brutality.

j)  The  referee,  if  the  mat  chairman  intervenes,  must  interrupt  the  bout  and  proclaim  victory  by  technical
superiority when the wrestlers’ scores of the match are 8 points  difference in Greco Roman wrestling and
10 points   difference in Men’s Freestyle and Women’s Freestyle. In this situation, they must wait for the
action -  either an attack or a counterattack - to be complete. Technical superiority is not finalized until
the athletes return to a neutral position.



## Article 19 –   The Judge


a) The judge is responsible for all the duties stipulated in the general Rules of wrestling.

b) They must follow the course of the bout very closely without allowing distraction. They must award points
for each action, and mark them on the score sheet, in agreement with the referee or mat chairman. The judge
must give an opinion in all situations.

c) Following each action, the judge compares the referees’ indication with their own assessment and records
the corresponding number of points. If the referee’s signal is unclear, the judge refers to the mat chairman’s
indication.

d) The judge verifies and signals the fall (TOUCHE) to the referee and the mat chairman.

e) If, during the bout, the judge notices something that should be brought to the referee’s attention because
the latter was not able to see it or did not notice it (a fall, illegal hold, passive position, etc.), the judge is
obliged to do so by raising the bat of the same color as the singlet of the wrestler in question, even if the
referee has not asked for their opinion. In all circumstances, the judge must call the referee’s attention to
anything that seems abnormal or irregular in the course of the bout or in the conduct of the wrestlers.

f) The judge must, moreover, sign the score sheet handed to him upon receipt, and at the end of the bout,
must clearly record on the score sheet the result of the bout by distinctly crossing out the name of the loser
and writing in the name and country of the winner.

g)  The  decisions  of  the  referee  and  judge  are  valid  and enforceable  without  the  intervention  of  the  mat
chairman  if  they  are  in  agreement  - except  for  proclamation  of  victory  by  technical  superiority,  passivity,
cautions and the fall in which case the mat chairman is required to confirm.

h) The judge’s score sheet must accurately indicate the time at which a bout ends in the case of victory by a
fall, technical superiority, etc.

i) To make it easier for the judge to supervise the bout, particularly in a delicate position, they are authorized
to change positions, but only along the edge of the mat over which they have control.

j) They must also indicate by underlining, the points scored in the last action which can determine the winner
of the bout.

k) Cautions for fleeing the mat/hold, illegal holds, or brutality will be noted by an ‘O’ in the column of the
wrestler at fault.



## 18

l) The judge will note the Passivity by noting a ‘P’ in the column of the wrestler at fault and the verbal warning
will be noted by a ‘V’.

## Article 20 – The Mat Chairman

a) The mat chairman shall assume all the duties provided for in the Wrestling Rules.

b) They shall co-ordinate the work of the referee and the judge.

c)   They shall follow the course of the bouts very carefully, without allowing distractions, and to evaluate the
behavior and action of the other officials according to the Rules.

d) In the event of any disagreement between the referee and judge, it is the mat chairman’s responsibility to
resolve the issue and determine the result, the value of points and any falls.

e) In no case may the mat chairman be the first to give an opinion on a scoring action.  The mat chairman does
not initiate scoring decisions but confirms or resolves disputes between the referee and the judge.

f) The mat chairman’s approval must absolutely be sought in passivity, caution and before granting a fall.

g) The mat chairman may decide to interrupt the bout in case of a serious mistake made by the referee.

h) They may also interrupt the bout if a serious scoring mistake is made by the referee and/or the judge. In
such  case,  they must  ask  for  a  consultation. If  the  mat  chairman  does  not  obtain  majority  during  the
consultation,  they must  stand  for  either  the  referee  or  the  judge.  This  consultation  does  not  alter  the
wrestler’s right to the challenge.

i) During a bout, when the coach considers that a blatant refereeing mistake has been made against his wrestler
and calls for a challenge, the mat chairman must wait for the attack or counterattack to finish before stopping
the match.  The refereeing delegate (or substitute) and the mat chairman must review the video evidence. If
the refereeing delegate (or substitute) agrees that the refereeing body was right, the mat chairman must make
sure that no other challenge will be granted to the wrestler in question during the remaining of the match.

After  the  review  of  the  video  evidence,  the  refereeing  delegate  (or  substitute)  solely  renders  the decision
which is final and cannot be challenged.



Article 21 – Penalties against the Refereeing Body


The UWW Bureau, which constitutes the supreme jury, shall collectively have the right to take the following
disciplinary measures against the member(s) of the refereeing body technically at fault, upon report by the
competitions’ delegates:

- Give the official(s) concerned a warning
- Suspension from competition for one or more sessions
- Withdraw the official(s) from the competition

Other sanctions as decided by the UWW Disciplinary Chamber may apply depending on the seriousness of the
fault.

## CHAPTER 5 – THE BOUT


Article 22 – Duration of the Bout

For U15, U17 and veterans: the duration of a bout will be two periods of 2 minutes with a 30-second break.

For U20, U23 and Seniors: the duration of a bout will be two periods of 3 minutes with a 30-second break.

For all the competitions, the timing displayed on the scoreboards will start from 6 to 0 minute (from 4 to 0
minute for U15,  U17 and veterans).

The winner is declared by the addition of the points in both periods at the end of the regular time.


Article 23 – Call to the Mat

The contestants are called in a loud and clear voice to present themselves on the mat. A contestant cannot
be called to compete in a new bout until a rest period of twenty (20) minutes has been completed from the
conclusion of the preceding bout.

A  delay  is  granted  to  any  wrestler  who  does  not  reply  to  the  first  request  in  the  following  manner:  The
competitors must be called three times at 30-second intervals.
These calls are made in English. If the wrestler
does not come forward after the third call, they will be eliminated, ranked last, without rank and the opponent
will win the bout by forfeit.


Article 24 – Presentation of Wrestlers

The following ceremony takes place for each weight category in the finals for first and second places: The
finalists are presented and their achievements    are announced when they are coming on the mat.


## Article 25 – Start

Before the bout begins, each opponent answers when his name is called and takes his place at the corner of
the mat assigned to him. The corner is the same color as the singlet he has been assigned to wear.

The referee, standing in the central circle in the middle of the mat, calls the two wrestlers to his side. He
then shakes hands with them and examines their dress, checks that they are not covered with any
greasy or sticky substance, verifies that they are not perspiring, verifies that their hands are bare.

The wrestlers greet each other, shake hands and, when the referee blows the whistle, they start the bout.


Article 26 – Interrupting the Bout

a)  If a contestant finds himself forced to interrupt the period because of an injury or because of any other
acceptable incident beyond their control, the referee may stop the bout. During such an interruption, the
wrestler(s) must stand in their corner. They can cover their shoulders with a towel or their dressing gown
and receive advice from their coach.

b)     If a bout cannot be resumed for medical reasons, the decision is made by the competition doctor in charge,
who informs both the coach of the wrestler involved and the mat chairman; the latter then orders that the
bout be stopped. The decision rendered by the competition’s doctor may not be reversed.



## 20

c)    Under no circumstances may a contestant take the initiative to interrupt the action, by deciding to wrestle
in the standing or "parterre" position. If this occurs, the first infraction will be a warning and the second
time will be a caution and 1 point for fleeing the hold.

d)  If an action must be stopped due to one wrestler deliberately injuring the opponent, the injured wrestler
is the winner and the wrestler at fault will be disqualified from the competition.

e)   If  a  wrestler  interrupts  the  bout  without  any  blood  or  visible  injury  as  determined  by  the  competition
doctor, 1 point will be awarded to the opponent. The bout shall resume immediately in the same position
as before the interruption.

f)    In case of bleeding of one of the wrestlers, the referee shall interrupt the bout. The mat chairman will start
a  chronometer  as  soon  as  the  doctor  begins  treating  the  athlete.  In  case  the  accumulated  time  of
interruptions to  treat  the  bleeding  exceeds  4  minutes  over  the  entire  duration  of  the  bout, the  mat
chairman shall order the end of the bout. In that case, if   the concerned wrestler still has visible bleeding,
they will loses  the match and the opponent will win the match by injury default. Should the bleeding time
expire but the treatment has been completed, the athlete may continue to wrestle but will lose the match
during any subsequent bleeding events. If the bout is wrestled until the end, the athlete’s chronometer
will be reset to zero prior to their next match.

g) After the medical treatment, the bout resumes in the same position as before the interruption.

h)  If a bout is interrupted because of any incident beyond the athletes’ control, the referee may stop the
bout and the remaining time of the bout will be completed as soon as the interruption ends. If a session
can’t  be  concluded  in  the  expected  schedule,  it  may  be  postponed  until  the  next  day.  If  it  is  the  last
competition day and for extraordinary reasons, the end of the competition may be postponed until a later
date and take place in another location.

i) In case of a serious mistake which is not seen by officiating team (examples; timekeeper mistakes, wrong
points  or  caution  published  on  the  scoreboard,  mistake  in  resuming  the  bout  in  parterre  or  in  standing
position, declaration of incorrect winner, clear fall not given, brutality, etc.), the referee delegate/s may
interfere and ask to correct it by consultation, or by video review.


Article 27 – End of the Bout

The bout ends either when a fall, a disqualification by injury of one of the opponents are declared, or at the
end of the regular time.

A match ends by technical superiority (8 points difference in Greco Roman wrestling and 10 points difference
in Freestyle and Women’s wrestling) once the athletes return to a neutral position.

If the referee has not heard the gong, the mat chairman must intervene and stop the bout by throwing a soft
object on the mat, in order to attract the referee’s attention. Any action begun at the time when the gong
sounds is not validated and no action performed between the sounds of the gong and the referee’s whistle is
valid.

When the bout has ended, the referee stands in the center of the mat facing the mat chairman’s table. The
wrestlers shake hands, stand on either side of the referee and await the decision. They are forbidden to lower
the  shoulder  straps  of  their  singlet  before  leaving  the  competition  hall.  Immediately  after  the  decision  is
announced, the wrestlers shake hands with the referee.

Each wrestler must then shake hands with his opponent’s coach. If the above provisions are not observed, the
wrestler at fault will be penalized in accordance with the Disciplinary Regulations.





## 21

Article 28 – Interrupting and Continuing the Bout

Wrestling must be stopped and resumed at the center of the mat in the standing position if:

- One foot entirely touches the protection area and no action is executed by either wrestler.
- The wrestlers in a hold go into the passivity zone with three or four feet without executing the hold
and stay there.
- If the bottom wrestler’s head entirely touches the protection zone.
- If a fault is committed by the offensive athlete during parterre wrestling.
- In all cases of illegal actions in standing position such as fleeing the hold, fleeing the mat, faults or
injuries.


Wrestling will resume in the parterre position if:
- While wrestling in parterre, the match was stopped for technical superiority and during the challenge,
or referee consultation, it was determined to be scored incorrectly.
- The  match  was  stopped  for  risk,  but  during  the  challenge,  or  referee  consultation,  points  were
awarded.
- In  the  case  of  an  injury  or  a  fault  committed  by  the  defensive  athlete  (such  as  fleeing  the  hold  or
fleeing the mat) during "parterre” wrestling.

To save the attacking wrestler, if he/she lifts his/her opponent from the ground during “parterre” wrestling
and the defensive wrestler prevents the attack through an illegal action, the referee will penalize the wrestler
at  fault  by  caution  1 point  in  Freestyle  and  caution  2  points  in  Greco-Roman  Wrestling  to  the  opponent
regardless if the attacking wrestler has succeeded or not in the hold and bout will continue in “parterre”. If
the attacking wrestler successfully completes the hold, the appropriate score will also be awarded in addition
to the caution.

When a challenge is requested by a coach, the mat chairman interrupts the bout when the action is back to
neutral. If  the  wrestler  disagrees  with  his coach’s  decision,  he  must  reject  the  challenge  directly  and  the
match continues.


Article 29 –   Types of Victories

A bout may be won:

- by "fall"
- by injury,
- by 3 cautions given to the opponent during a bout
- by technical superiority
- following a forfeit
- by a disqualification
- by points (by having at least 1 point more after the addition of the two periods)

- Refer to Article 41 for the details of each victory

In case of a tie by points, the winner will be declared by successively considering:

- The action/hold of the highest value.
- The biggest number of action(s)/hold(s) of the highest value.
- The least number of cautions.
- The last technical point(s) scored
4.1. Except  in  Greco-Roman  Wrestling,  if  the  score  ends  1-1,  with  both  points  being  from  the
opponent’s passivity, the first point scored will determine the winner of the bout.
4.1.1. Except in Greco-Roman Wrestling, if the score ends 1-1, but the first point scored is not
technical (i.e., passivity of the opponent point, challenge lost by the opponent point, and
similar  situations),  and  the  second  point  scored  is  technical  (result  of  a  technical
action/hold or step out), then the technical point will have a “higher value” than the non-


## 22

technical point, and the winner will be the last wrestler to score, for that wrestler has
scored the “technical point”.

Please see below all the examples linked to that specific situation.


## Example:
## Red Blue Comment Result

## 23


## Article 30 – The Coach

The coach may remain at the foot of the platform or at least two meters from the edge of the mat during the
bout. If the UWW doctor (or the competition doctor) allows the coach, he is authorized to assist the injury
treatment of the wrestler.  Except  during  this  situation  and  during  the  break,  it  is  strictly  forbidden  to  the
coach to step on the mat which may result in sanction by the referee.

The coach is strictly forbidden to influence decisions or to insult the refereeing body. They may only speak to
the wrestler. The coach has the right to give water to the wrestler only during the break. No other substance
may be given during the pause or during the match.

It is the duty of the coach to wipe the wrestler during the break using a dry towel to remove perspiration.

If these restrictions are not observed, the referee is obliged to ask the mat chairman to present the coach
with a ‘Yellow’ card (caution); if the coach persists, the mat chairman will present a ‘Red’ card (elimination).
The mat chairman may also take the initiative to present the YELLOW or RED card.

As soon as the red card is given, the mat chairman reports to the competition director and the coach shall be
eliminated from the competition and may no longer continue their duties. These facts also need to be reported
on the scoresheet of the concerned bout. However, the wrestling team involved shall have the right to obtain
the services of another coach. The National Federation of the eliminated coach will be penalized following
the dispositions of the Disciplinary and Financial Regulations.

Moreover, if a coach gets two yellow cards during one competition (not necessarily during the same bout),
they will be also eliminated from the competition and may no longer continue their duties. As for the red card,
the coach’s accreditation will be removed.

A  maximum  of  two  accompanying  people  are authorized  to  enter  the  Field  of  Play  with  the  wrestler.  If  a
National Wrestling Federation has a doctor in its team, they may use the second place if they want to intervene
in case of injury.

It is also specified that a coach cannot officiate as a referee during the same competition. Moreover, a category
IS referee can’t be a national coach.


## Article 31 – The Challenge

The challenge is the action through which the coach is allowed, on behalf of the wrestler, to stop the action
and request the refereeing delegate (or substitute) and the mat chairman to watch the video evidence in case
of a disagreement with the call. The disagreement must be reasoned and may not be requested as a simple
protest otherwise the concerned coach will be sanctioned by a Yellow card.

This possibility only exists during competitions where video control is formally established by UWW and the
Organizing Committee. When an official broadcaster is appointed to cover the event, the broadcasting feeds
shall also be used, if   necessary,  to provide additional angles during challenge reviews.

The coach must request the challenge by pushing the button provided immediately after the refereeing body
has awarded or failed to award points to the contested situation. If the wrestler disagrees with the coach's
decision, t hey must reject the challenge directly and the match continues.

If electronic challenge buttons are unavailable during a competition, coaches may use a sponge provided by
the organizer to indicate a challenge.

The organizers also have the obligation to use the UWW competition management system and to project the
video on a big screen (1 per mat minimum) that must be visible from the entire venue. This screen can be
either a plasma screen or a white board used with a projector.



## 24

In case of a major technical problem which would not allow the review of the contested action, the refereeing
body’s initial decision will be enforced and the coach will keep his challenge.

Specific points

Each  wrestler  is  entitled  to  one  (1)  challenge  per  match.    If  after  reviewing  the  challenge  the  refereeing
delegate (or substitute) modifies the initial decision, then the challenge can be used again during the match
by the concerned wrestler.

If the refereeing delegate (or substitute) confirms the decision by the refereeing body, the wrestler loses the
challenge and the opponent will receive one (1) point.

The mat chairman shall demand to stop the match to review the challenge as soon as the wrestlers return to
a neutral position.

In  case  of  dispute  between  the  refereeing  body  and  the  coach,  the  refereeing  body  is  allowed  to  refuse  a
challenge  only  after  the  approval  of  the  refereeing delegate (or substitute).  The  mat  chairman  and/or  the
referee cannot decline a challenge without the approval of the referee delegate (or substitute).

No challenge can be requested for penalties given as a result of passive wrestling or in the event of a fall. The
fall must be confirmed by the mat chairman following the decision of either the referee or the judge. However,
a challenge may be accepted for situations involving illegal attacks or counterattacks, or for actions that occur
in the final seconds of the match, prior to the fall.

No challenge can be requested after the end of the regular time of a period, except when the points are added
to the scoreboard after the referee’s whistle or in case action occurred just before the time is over. The coach
has 10 seconds to request a challenge after the points are published on the scoreboard or after the wrestlers
return to a neutral position.

The challenge will not be accepted by the refereeing body after the winner has been declared.

The coach requesting the challenge must do so from their seat, without stepping on the mat or approaching
the  judge’s  or  the  mat  chairman’s  table.  Furthermore,  the  coach  is  not  allowed  to  indicate  his  challenge
request by throwing items on the mat unless provided with a sponge.

After having reviewed the action and after a consultation with the mat chairman, the refereeing delegate (or
substitute), renders the decision which w ill be final and may not be discussed.

It is not possible to request a “counter challenge” once a final decision has been made.


Article 32 – Team Ranking during Individual Competitions

The team ranking is determined by the first 10 wrestlers who are ranked at the competition.

The application of the above-mentioned table remains invariable, whatever the number of wrestlers in each
category.

In    the case of a weight category using the Nordic system, the above-mentioned table will be also used. The
athlete ranked in the 4
th
place will receive 12 points and if an athlete is ranked in the 6

place, he they will
receive 9 points.



## 25

In    the case of a disqualified athlete and the final ranking has only one wrestler in the 5
th
place, the athlete
ranked in the 6
th
place will receive 9 points.

If several teams have an equal amount of points, these teams  will be ranked following this criteria:

- most first places
- most second places
- most third places
- etc.

During a competition where a country can enter more than one athlete per weight category, the team points
are given only to the highest ranked athlete of a country in the category. The team ranking points allocation
will remain the same.

Article 33 – Ranking System during Team Competitions


The winning team will receive 1 team point and the losing one 0 team point.

If two teams have an equal number of team points, their direct match will determine the ranking.

If more than two teams have an equal number of team points, the ranking will be determined following these
criteria:

- The highest classification points
- The highest victories by fall
- The highest match victories by superiority
- The highest technical points scored
- The fewest technical points given
- The lowest draw number

In case of a tied match (same number of victories like 5-5) between two teams in a team competition, the
winner will be determined by successively reviewing the following criteria:

-  The total of classification points
-  The most victories by fall
-  The most match victories by technical superiority
-  The most technical points obtained during the match
-  The fewest technical points given during the match
-  The outcome of the last bout competed



## CHAPTER 6 – POINTS FOR ACTIONS AND HOLDS


Article 34 – Evaluation of the Importance of the Action or Hold

In order to encourage risk-taking during bouts, when a wrestler tries unsuccessfully to execute a hold (risk)
and finds themself underneath in a "parterre" position without a move by the opponent, the wrestler above


## 26

will not be awarded a technical point. The referee, following confirmation from the judge or    the mat chairman,
interrupts the bout and wrestling will restart in standing position. However, if, during a hold, the defending
wrestler executes a counterattack and is able to bring the opponent to the ground, the corresponding technical
point(s) will be awarded.

After the parterre position is established, a brief loss of knee contact from the mat will not be considered a
standing action.

If the attacking wrestler executes a hold on his own bridge, maintains this position for a period of time, and
then completes the action by placing the opponent in the bridge position as well, the attacking wrestler will
not be penalized. In this case, the attacking wrestler will be awarded points, as they will have successfully
executed a hold that involved risk. However, if the offensive wrestler is blocked and held under control in the
bridge position or is countered and controlled by the opponent, the points will be awarded to the opponent.

A hold executed in standing position is always valued more than the same hold performed in parterre position.
The value of a hold is  solely determined by the position of the attacked (defensive) wrestler. If the attacked
wrestler has at least one knee on the mat, their position is considered a “parterre” wrestling position. The
position of the attacking wrestler is not relevant when evaluating a hold.

Furthermore, the wrestler on whom a hold was initiated (defending wrestler) may only be awarded points if,
by his own action, he has:

a) Brought the attacking (offensive wrestler)  to the ground.

b) Conducted the action on a continuous basis.

c) Succeeded in controlling the offensive wrestler by blocking him in a bridge position, that is, in a position
considered completed.

During the execution of a hold, in cases where the wrestlers’ actions lead them to change from one position
to another, the points for all the actions are awarded according to their value. Rolling from one shoulder to
the other using the elbows in the bridge position, and vice-versa, is considered to be only one action. A hold
must be considered a new action until the competitors return to a defensible position. The referee must wait
for the end of each situation prior to awarding the point values earned by each wrestler.

At  the  end  of  a  period,  any  hold  is  valid  if  it  was  completed  before  time  expires.  In  no  event  may  a  hold
finished after the time has expired. In the event of a fall that occurs at the end of the regulation time, only
the time clock (and not the referee’s whistle) is valid.

The instantaneous fall, “both shoulders of the attacking wrestler touching simultaneously and instantaneously
the mat”, is not considered as a fall (totally controlled by the opponent) (article 42). If the defending wrestler
falls instantly from a standing position following a move by his opponent, the attacker receives four points
provided he demonstrates control.


## Article 35 – Danger Position

A wrestler shall be considered in the 'danger position' when the line of his back (or the line of his shoulders)
vertically or in parallel with the mat, forms an angle of less than 90 degrees to the mat and when he resists
with the upper part of his body to avoid a 'fall'. (See article “the fall”). The danger position occurs when:

- The defending wrestler assumes the bridge position to avoid being pinned.
- The defending wrestler, with his back toward the mat, supports himself on one or both elbows to avoid
having his shoulders forced onto the mat.
- The wrestler has one shoulder in contact with the mat or on the body of his/her opponent and at the
same time exceeds the 90-degree vertical line with the other shoulder (acute angle).
- The wrestler rolls on his shoulders.



## 27

The 'danger position' no longer exists when the wrestler exceeds the 90-degree vertical line with his chest and
stomach facing the mat.

If the mat and the competitor's back form a 90-degree angle only, this cannot yet be considered a 'danger
position' (the neutral point).


Article 36 – Recording the Points

The Mat Chairman and the judge marks the points obtained for the actions and holds executed by the wrestlers
on a score sheet, as each action is performed during the bout.

The points of the action bringing about a fall are to be noted on the score sheet by a circle.

The caution for fleeing the mat, fleeing a hold, refusal to start, illegal hold and brutality shall be noted by
(0). After each caution (0) the opponent will automatically receive at least o ne point.

In case of a tie in points, the last technical point scored shall be underlined.


## Article 37 – Grand Amplitude Throw

Any action or hold by a wrestler in the standing position or parterre that causes his opponent to lose all contact
with the ground, controls him, makes him describe a broadly sweeping curve in the air, and brings him to the
ground shall be considered a “Grand Amplitude” throw.


Article 38 – Values assigned to the Actions and Holds

1 point

- To the wrestler whose opponent goes in the protection zone with one entire foot (in standing position)
without executing a hold.

Clarification for stepping out in standing wrestling for both style:

-  When the attacking wrestler is the first to step into the protection area in the commission of a
hold, the following may occur:

. If the wrestler completes the hold successfully in a continuous action, he shall be awarded
the requisite points--1, 2, 4 or 5 points.
.  If  the wrestler  is  unable  to  complete  the  hold  successfully,  after  stopping  the  action  the
referee shall award 1 point to the opponent.
.  If  the  wrestler  lifts and  controls  the  opponent  but is  unable  to  complete  the hold  in  a
continuous action, the referee shall stop the bout but not award any point.

NB:  When a wrestler deliberately pushes the opponent into the protection area with no meaningful action,
he  shall  no  longer be  awarded  1  point  (only  verbal  warning).  However,  in  situations  where  the
defensive wrestler steps out of the protection area in a grounded position (on the knees), it shall be
considered as stepping out and the attacking wrestler shall be awarded 1 point.

- All the stops of bout by injury without bleeding or any visible injury are penalized by 1 point to the
opponent.
- To the wrestler whose opponent requested a challenge if initial decision is confirmed.
- To the opponent of a wrestler designated as passive who fails to score points during a 30 second activity
period in Freestyle wrestling.
- Reversal (counterattack by dominated wrestler in parterre position and passing behind)


## 28

2 points

- To the wrestler who overcomes and then controls the opponent by passing behind (three out of the
seven possible points of contact must be touching the mat simultaneously, including : hands, knees,
head, or elbows).
- To  the  wrestler  who  applies  a  correct  and  complete  throw  that  brings  the opponent  into  a  prone
position  (stomach)  or  lateral  position  (flank).  The  defensive  wrestler  must  lose  control  during  the
throw.
- To  the  wrestler  who  executes  a  hold  that  places  the  opponent's  back at an  angle  of  less  than  90
degrees, including when the opponent is on one or two outstretched arms.
- To the attacking wrestler whose opponent rolls onto the shoulders, turns their back to an angle of less
than 90 degrees or rotates hand to hand.
- To the wrestler who blocks the opponent in the execution of a hold from the standing position, in a

position in a continuous and dynamic manner.
- For any hold executed by lifting a wrestler from the ground and placing the opponent into a danger
position,  over  a  short  amplitude,  even  if  one  or  both  of  the  attacking  wrestler’s  knees  are  on  the
ground.
- To the wrestler who executes a grand amplitude hold which does not place the opponent in a direct
and immediate danger position.
- For any throw executed from standing or parterre where the opponent is completely lifted from the
ground and lands on the chest or one / two outstretched arms. The defensive wrestler must rotate
(any direction) over a short amplitude.

NB. If, in performing a hold, the defending wrestler maintains contact with the mat with only one hand, but
is immediately placed in a danger position, the attacking wrestler will receive 4 points.

5 points

- All grand amplitude throws executed in a standing position which place the defending wrestler to a
direct and immediate danger position.


## 29

- The hold executed by a wrestler in the "parterre" position who completely lifts his opponent off the
ground with the execution of a high amplitude throw which projects the opponent into a direct and
immediate danger position.


Article 39 –   Decision and Vote

The referee shall indicate the decision by raising their arm and clearly showing the points with their fingers.
If the referee and judge agree, the decision is announced. The mat chairman is not entitled to influence or
change a decision if the referee and judge are in agreement except if he calls for a consultation or after a
challenge.

If a vote is taken, the judge and mat chairman must indicate their votes using paddles or an electric score
board. There are 11 paddles in Greco Roman and in Freestyle Wrestling. They are painted in different colors:
blue, red and white.

One white,  five  red,  four  of  which  are  numbered  1,  2,  4,  5  to  indicate  the  points  and  one  of  which  is  an
unmarked paddle intended for cautions and to attract attention to the wrestler concerned; five blue paddles,
four of which are numbered like the red paddles, with one paddle unmarked.

They must be kept within easy reach of those who are to use them. Under no circumstances may the judge
abstain from voting. He must express a decision clearly, leaving no room for ambiguity.

In the event of a disagreement between the referee and the judge, the mat chairman shall make the final
decision. The mat chairman must choose between the two opposing opinions and is required to vote in favor
of one or the other.

If  the  match  lasts  until  the  end  of  the  allotted  time,  the  mat  chairman's  score  sheet  will  be  taken  into
consideration when designating the winner. The public scoreboard must conform to the mat chairman’s score
sheet at all times during the bout. If there is a difference of 1 or more points between the judge’s and mat
chairman’s score sheets, only the score on the mat chairman’s score sheet will be considered.


## Article 40 – Decision Table

When observing a wrestling action, the referee and judge award the points, cautions, indicated below which,
in each of the cases put forward, provides the following result:

R: Red wrestler – B: Blue wrestler – 0: Zero point

## Referee Judge Mat Chairman Official Result Observations

## Article 42 – The Fall

A fall is considered valid when the defensive wrestler is held by their opponent with both shoulders in contact
with the mat long enough for the referee to confirm the complete control of the position. To be recognized
as a valid fall at the edge of the mat, both shoulders of the wrestler must be within the orange zone, and their
entire head must not touch the protection area. A fall occurring in the protection area is not valid.

If   the wrestler is pinned on both shoulders as a result of their own illegal hold or rule infringement, the fall
shall be awarded to their opponent.

The fall observed by the referee will be valid if confirmed by the mat chairman. If the referee does not indicate
the fall, and if the fall is valid, it may be announced by the judge with confirmation from the mat chairman.
In all cases, the referee will strike the mat only after he has obtained confirmation from the mat chairman.
The referee will then blow his whistle in order to end the bout.

It will not be possible to request any challenge in case of a fall, unless the challenge is for an illegal action
which lead to the fall.



## 31

Any wrestler who is controlled by his/her opponent in the danger position, who shouts,  hits the mat, or shows
any sign of “tapping out”, without any reason or any clear injury, the referee will not stop the bout and if
he/she continues to shout, referee will ask for fall and mat chairman will confirm it.


## Article 43 – Technical Superiority

Except from the fall and the disqualification, the bout must be stopped before the end of regular time when:

- There are 8 points difference in Greco Roman style and 10 points difference in Freestyle between the
wrestlers

The bout may not be interrupted to declare the winner by technical superiority until the athletes return to a
neutral position (see article 27).

The mat chairman signals the referee when the 8 or 10 points difference has been attained. The referee shall
declare the winner after confirmation from the mat chairman.






## CHAPTER 8 – NEGATIVE WRESTLING


Article 44 – Par Terre Position during the Bout

If  one  of  the  wrestlers  brings  the opponent  to  the  ground  during  the  match,  wrestling  continues  in  the
“parterre” position and the wrestler underneath may counter their opponent’s efforts, stand up or carry out
counter-attacks. If a wrestler brings the opponent to the ground but, due to effective defensive action by the
opponent is unable to continue the attack, the referee shall stops the bout after a reasonable period of time
and have the wrestlers resume the bout in a standing position.

While defending attacks and holds from the top wrestler in Greco Roman, the bottom wrestler is not allowed
to place more than one of his hands on the opponent’s upper body (torso or any part of the opponent arms).
Furthermore, the bottom wrestler must not defend with closed arm(s)    or block off with elbows and knees.
Once the hold has been locked, the defensive wrestler may close the arms to defend the hold. For freestyle,
the bottom wrestler must not defend with two closed arms.

The  wrestler  on  top  has  no  right  to  interrupt  the  bout  nor  to  request  that  wrestling  resume  in  a  standing
position.

Ordering of parterre position

The initial position of wrestlers in parterre position before the referee blows the whistle is as follows: The
bottom wrestler must lie on his stomach in the center of the mat. Arms shall be stretched out to the front and
legs  shall  be  stretched  out  to  the  back.  Arms  and/or  legs  can’t  be  crossed.  Hands  and  feet  of  the  bottom
wrestler must touch the mat. The top wrestler is placed sideways to the opponent, with both knees on the
mat, placing  both  hands  on  the  back  the  opponent without  any  hesitation  after  the  parterre  position  is
ordered.

After the referee blows the whistle, the bottom wrestler is allowed to defend according to the Rulebook. It’s
especially forbidden to jump or flee from the attacker, to defend with closed arms or blocking off with elbows
and knees as well as to use actively any leg while defending (i  n Greco-Roman wrestling). Nevertheless, the
wrestler underneath is allowed to stand up after the referee has blown the whistle.





## 32

Penalty for wrestler who refuses the correct ordered parterre start:

Top wrestler

- First time -   verbal warning
- Second time –  lose the position and restart in standing position

Bottom wrestler

- First time -   verbal warning
- Second time -   caution to the wrestler at fault and 1 point in FS / 2 points in GR are awarded to the
opponent and the match will restart in the parterre position.


Article 45 – Passivity Zone (Orange zone)

The orange  colored  passivity  zone  is  provided  for  the  purpose  of  detecting  the  passive  wrestler  and  it  is
intended to help eliminate systematic wrestling on the edge of the mat and any departures from the wrestling
area.

Any hold or action begun on the central wrestling area and ending within that zone are valid including position
of danger, counterattack and fall.

Any hold or counterattack begun in the standing position on the central wrestling area of the mat (apart from
the  passivity  zone)  is  good,  regardless  of  the  place  where  it  finishes  (wrestling  area,  passivity  zone  or
protection area). However, if the hold or counterattack ends in the protection area, the bout is stopped and
the wrestlers are returned to the center of the mat to resume wrestling in the standing position. Points will
be awarded according to the value of the hold.

A  fall  in  the  protection  area  is  not  valid.  The  bout  must  be  interrupted  and  the  wrestlers  are returned  in
standing position to the center of the mat because the hold ended off the mat.

An action, which is not evaluated with points in the wrestling area, can also not be evaluated with points in
the protection area. Only 1 point for going out of bound will be given to the deserved wrestler.

As a general rule for going-out-of-bounds without executing a successful hold, the wrestler who stepped out
first will lose 1 point (meaning that his opponent will be awarded with 1 point). If both wrestlers go out of
bounds together, the referee will have to determine which wrestler touched to protection area first and award
his opponent with one point.

If a wrestler attempts a hold unsuccessfully and ends up underneath in the protection area, in a neutral position
without the opponent initiating any additional action (risk), the wrestler shall lose one point for going out of
bounds  first  from  standing  position.  If  the  same  action  results  in  the  wrestler  landing  on  their  back  in  the
protection area under the control of the opponent, two points shall be awarded to the opponent.

When executing a hold or action that begins on the central wrestling area, wrestlers may enter the passivity
zone with up to three of four feet and continue their actions in any direction, provided that the execution of
the hold is not interrupted by pushing, blocking, or pulling. In such cases, the referee shall allow the situation
to continue briefly to determine whether the hold develops.

An action or a hold may not be commenced in a standing position in the passivity zone, except under the strict
condition that the wrestlers engaged in the hold have only two feet in the zone. In this case, the referee will
tolerate the situation for a limited period of time, waiting for the hold to be developed.

If the wrestlers stop their action in the passivity zone and remain there,  or if they enter the zone with two,
three or four feet without initiating an action, the referee shall stop the bout and brings the wrestlers back to
the center, the bout resumes in standing position.



## 33

In  all  cases,  in  standing  position,  if  one  of  the  attacking  wrestler’s  foot  is  in  the  protection  area,  which  is
outside the passivity zone, the referee will not interrupt the bout and will wait for action to be completed.

When the defending wrestler’s foot is in the protection area, but the attacking wrestler carries out a hold
without  interruption,  the  hold  is  good.  If  the  attacking  wrestler  does  not  carry  out  the  hold,  the  referee
interrupts the bout.

When the defending wrestler places one of his foot in the passivity zone, the referee must call ‘ZONE’ in a
loud  voice.  Upon  hearing  this  word,  the  wrestlers  must  endeavor to  return  towards  the  center  of  the  mat
without interrupting their action.

When wrestling in the "parterre" position, any action, hold or counterattack executed from or in the passivity
zone is good, even if it ends in the protection area.

The referee and judge will award points for all actions initiated in "parterre" position in the passivity zone and
executed in the protection area. However, the bout will be stopped and the match will be resumed in the
center of the mat in a standing position.

When wrestling in the "parterre" position, the attacking wrestler may continue his action if he moves out of
the passivity zone while executing the hold, provided that the shoulders and head of his opponent are within
the passivity zone. In this case, even four legs may be in the protection area.

Article 46 –Enforcement of Passivity (Freestyle and Greco Roman)


Procedure for enforcement of penalties for inactivity in Freestyle wrestling

One  of  the  roles  of  the  refereeing  body  should  be  to  evaluate  and  distinguish  what  is  real  action  versus  a
feigned attempt to waste time.

a. Anytime  the  refereeing  body  agrees  a  wrestler  is  blocking,  interlocking  fingers,  thwarting  his
opponent  and/or  generally  avoiding  wrestling:  the  referee  signals  to  the  wrestler  “Action blue  or
red”. First offence, the action is stopped briefly to give a verbal warning (V): “Attention”. Second
offence:  the  action  is  stopped  briefly  to  designate  the  guilty  wrestler,  the  passive  wrestler  is
indicated on the scoreboard and a 30-second mandatory-score period begins. The referee shall not
interrupt  the  bout  in  the  midst  of  a  viable  action  to  either  start  or  finish  an  activity  period.  The
passive wrestler should score point(s) in the 30 seconds otherwise his opponent will score one point
even if he scores point(s) during that period.

b. If after 2:00 minutes into the first period neither wrestler has scored (0-0), the referee must designate
one wrester as inactive. The same procedure described above shall then applied.

c. When  there  is  less  than  30  seconds  remaining  in  either  period,  if  all  three  of  the  refereeing  body
agree a wrestler is evading and/or blocking his opponent, then his/her opponent is awarded one point
and caution (i.e fleeing the hold). This situation can be challenged.

d. If  a  wrestler  initiates  his  action  some  seconds  before  minute  2:00  in  3  minutes  rounds  with  a  0:0
score,  the referee will not interrupt the bout and will allow the wrestler to finish the action. If the
action ends with points, the bout will continue without any interruption. If the action doesn’t end
with points, the referee will stop the bout and will apply the activity time from the time the match
was stopped.

e.
For U15, U17 and Veterans age categories, no verbal warning will be given. The passivity
procedure starts directly with activity time.
. If, after one minute in the first period, neither
wrestler has scored (0–0), the referee must designate one wrestler as inactive and start activity time.
If a wrestler initiates his action some seconds before minute 1:00 in 2 minute rounds with a 0:0 score,
the  referee  will  allow  wrestlers  to  finish  the  action.  If  the  action  ends  with  points,  the  bout  will


## 34

continue without any interruption. If the action doesn’t end with points, the referee will stop the
bout and will apply the activity time from the time the match was stopped.


Procedure for enforcement of penalties for inactivity in Greco-Roman wrestling

Active Wrestling is defined by seeking contact with the opponent, hooking each other and trying to set up an
attack. Both wrestlers are always encouraged to perform Active Wrestling.

If only one wrestler is performing Active Wrestling, he will be rewarded. In such cases, his opponent who is
blocking and preventing Active Wrestling will be determined as passive and the appropriate passivity procedure
takes place.


The following procedure will be enforced:

## • 1
st
passivity in a match (regardless which wrestler), the bout is stopped, active wrestler receives 1
point and can choose between standing or parterre wrestling (P).

## • 2
nd
passivity in a match (regardless which wrestler), the bout is stopped, active wrestler receives 1
point and can choose between standing or parterre wrestling (P).

## • 3
rd
and any further passivity in a match (regardless which wrestler), the bout is stopped and the
active wrestler can choose between standing or parterre wrestling (P). The active wrestler will not be
awarded with 1 point.

There are three scenarios in which the refereeing team needs to stimulate a match with a passivity call:

a) Score is 0:0
b) Score is tied and one wrestler is clearly more active
c) One wrestler has the lead and his opponent acts too defensively

A  wrestler  who  has  scored  points  by  executing  holds  in  standing  wrestling  should  not  be  punished  with  a
passivity. However, if this aforementioned wrestler is inactive for a certain amount of time and his opponent
scored points or is clearly more active, he can receive a passivity.
Criteria to consider a wrestler as passive:
- Evading attacks without counterattacks
- Grabbing opponent wrists without starting an attack
- Attacking without any direct contact with the opponent
- Regaining initial position right after beginning an attack
- Fake attacks (Simulation)
- Evading into and maintaining in the passivity zone
- Avoiding Wrestling in the center of the mat
- Fixing his opponent in the passivity zone
- No hooking despite good position
- Defensive wrestling

## Clarification

Any passivity must be confirmed by the mat chairman. If in applying the passivity procedure a serious mistake
is made by the referee and the judge, the mat chairman must intervene.



## 35

If  a  wrestler  is  blocking,  keeping  his  head  down  on  his  opponent  chest,  interlocking  fingers,  or  in  general
avoiding open wrestling in standing position (refusing to come back on a straighter upper body position), the
referee will determine this wrestler as being negative.

Negative Wrestling describes every action which is potentially dangerous to the opponent or contrary to the
basic principle to provide an offensive and spectacular way of wrestling (e.g. interlocking fingers, avoiding
contact).

Negative Wrestling must be stated by the referee upon the first clear sign of it (e.g. "Red, no fingers!”) and
needs to be confirmed by the mat chairman.

Once confirmed, Negative Wrestling will be declared immediately and a caution (0) and 1 point in Freestyle
and a caution (0) and 2 points in Greco-Roman is awarded to the opponent.

Negative Wrestling as defined above and in Articles 47-50 must not be penalized with Passivity Call.

Passivity  and  Negative  Wrestling  have  to  be  distinguished  from  each  other.  It  is  not  possible  to  penalize
Passivity with a Negative Wrestling call or vice versa. Passivity and Negative Wrestling are distinctly different.

Note:  the  procedures  for  the  enforcement  of  passivity  for  the  Freestyle  and  Greco-Roman  disciplines  are
distinctly different.





## CHAPTER 9 – PROHIBITIONS AND ILLEGAL HOLDS


## Article 47 – General Prohibitions

Wrestlers are forbidden to:

- Pull the hair, ears, genitals, pinch the skin, bite, twist fingers or toes, etc. and generally, to perform
actions, gestures or holds with the intention of torturing the opponent or making him suffer to force
him to withdraw.
- Kick, head-butt, strangle, push, apply holds that may endanger the opponent’s life or cause a fracture
or dislocation of limbs or touch his face between the eyebrows and the line of the mouth.
- Tread on the feet of the opponent (only in GR)
- Thrust the elbow or knee into the opponent's abdomen or stomach, carry out any twisting action which
is likely to cause suffering, or hold the opponent by his singlet.
- Cling to or grasp the mat.
- Talk during the bout.
- Seize the sole of the opponent’s foot (only seizing the upper part of the foot or the heel is permitted).
- Agree with the match result between themselves.
- Grasping or interlocking fingers to block the opponent and prevent Active Wrestling.
- To spit the water out during the break.

These general prohibitions are sanctioned based on the severity of the foul (disqualification, caution-1(2) point
or verbal warning). Disciplinary sanctions might also be applied after the competition against the athlete at
fault.



Article 48 – Fleeing a Hold

Fleeing  a  hold  occurs  when  the  defending  wrestler  openly  refuses  contact  to  prevent the opponent from
executing or initiating a hold. These situations arise in both the standing and "parterre" positions. They may


## 36

occur in the central wrestling area or from the central wrestling area to the orange zone. Fleeing a hold shall
be penalized in the following manner:


Fleeing the hold in “parterre” wrestling:

- 1 caution against the wrestler at fault (0)
- 1 point to the opponent
- Restart in “parterre” position


Fleeing the hold in standing wrestling:

- 1 caution against the wrestler at fault (0)
- 1 point to the opponent
- Restart in standing position

Fleeing a hold in the parterre position in Greco-Roman

Following an opponent’s action in parterre wrestling, should the bottom wrestler jump forward to avoid being
caught in a hold and this movement places the opponent at risk of committing an illegal hold if they grab the
escaping  wrestler’s  thighs,  this  is  considered  fleeing  the  hold.  The  referee  must  not  allow  this  situation  to
occur, as it constitutes a fleeing-the-hold offence by the escaping wrestler. The referee shall be clear and
precise in managing this infraction and most position themself in front of the wrestlers to prevent the escape
from taking place.

- The first time that the wrestler on the ground jumps forward to avoid being caught by his opponent,
the referee must warn aloud "attention, no jump".
- The second time, the referee must request a caution and 1 point for fleeing the hold, stop the match
following  agreement  by  the  judge  and  the  mat  chairman,  make  the  wrestlers  stand  up,  signal  the
offence and restart the match in “parterre” position.

This method is valid for penalizing fleeing the hold when the wrestler jumps forward. However, the defense
of moving laterally to avoid a hold is authorized and should not be sanctioned.

The wrestler who is dominated on the ground in Greco-Roman does not have the right to bend or raise either
or both of his legs to prevent a hold being executed.


Article 49 –   Fleeing the Mat

When a wrestler flees the mat, from either a standing or “parterre” position, a caution shall immediately be
issued against the wrestler at fault. The following points shall be awarded to the attacking wrestler:

Fleeing the mat in “parterre” wrestling:
- 1 caution against the wrestler at fault (0)
- 1 point to the opponent
- Restart in “parterre” position

Note: Control does not need to be established for the action to be considered parterre wrestling

Fleeing the mat in a danger position (Freestyle and Greco-Roman Wrestling):
- 2   points  + 1 caution against the opponent
- Restart in “parterre” position

Fleeing the mat from standing position during an attack that results with take down in the protection area will
be rewarded by 2 points (for take down) and Caution + 1 point (for fleeing the mat) in all styles. The bout
restarts in parterre position.



## 37

Fleeing the mat from standing position during an attack that does not end with take down in the protection
area will be rewarded by 1 point (for stepping out) and Caution + 1 point (for fleeing the mat) in all styles.
The bout restarts in standing position.

If the defensive wrestler intentionally drops to the knees in the zone and deliberately enters the protection
area, this is considered fleeing the mat.

When one of the wrestlers steps on the passivity zone for the first time the referee is obliged to warn them
(blue zone / red zone). Wrestlers are obligated to return to the center of the mat. If wrestlers do not obey
this command and step on the mat with 3 feet in the passivity zone, the referee must stop the bout and bring
back the wrestlers in the center of the mat. If it’s an attacking move, the points will be given to the attacking
wrestler  for  the  action,  even  if  legs  of  both  wrestlers  are  in  the  orange  zone  or  if  one  or  both  legs  of  the
defending wrestler are on the protection area. No counter action performed on the protective area will be
admitted and awarded.


## Article 50 – Illegal Holds

The following holds and actions are illegal and strictly prohibited:

- Throat hold
- Twisting of arms more than 90 degrees
- Arm lock applied to the forearm
- Holding the head or neck with two hands, as well as all situations and positions of strangulation
- Double Nelson, if not executed from the side without the use of the legs on any part of the opponent’s
body
- Bringing the opponent’s arm behind his back and at the same time applying pressure to it in a position
where the forearm forms an acute angle
- Executing a hold by stretching the opponent’s spinal column
- Holds including solely the head (the only holds allowed are with the head and one arm)
- In standing, holds executed from behind when the opponent is head down (reverse waist hold), the
fall must be executed only to the side and never from top to bottom (header)
- Two hands or arms on the head. In executing a hold, only one arm may be used to hold the opponent’s
head or neck
- Lifting the opponent who is in a bridge position and then throwing them    onto the mat (severe impact
on the ground); that is, the bridge must be forced down
- Breaking the bridge by pushing in the direction of the head
- Generally, if the attacking wrestler is found to have violated the Rules during the execution of a hold,
the  action  in  question  shall  be  completely  void  and  on  the  first  offence,  the  referee  shall  give  an
“attention”  to  the  attacking  wrestler  at  fault.  If  the  attacker  repeats  his  violation,  they will  be
punished by a caution and 1 point.
- If  a  defending  wrestler,  by  an  illegal  action,  prevents  the opponent  from  developing  a  hold,  the
defending wrestler will be cautioned. Their opponent will receive one point in FS and two points in
## GR.


Prohibited holds for Women’s wrestling

All double Nelsons holds in the "parterre" or standing position are forbidden in Women’s wrestling.

Prohibited holds for U15 and U17

To protect the health of young wrestlers, the following holds are considered illegal and prohibited:

- Double Nelson from both the front and side






## 38

Referee’s duty towards the wrestlers committing a violation

If the attacking wrestler can carry out the action in spite of an illegal hold of the defending wrestler:

- Indicate the violation
- Stop the violation
- Give the value corresponding to the hold to the opponent
- Ask for a caution
- Give 1 point (Freestyle) or 2 points (Greco-Roman) to the opponent
- Stop the match
- Resume wrestling in the position where the infraction occurred

If the attacking wrestler cannot carry out the action because of an illegal hold of the defending wrestler

- Indicate the violation
- Stop the match and ask for a caution
- Give 1 point (Freestyle) or 2 points (Greco-Roman) to the opponent
- Resume wrestling in the position where the infraction occurred


## Article 51 – Special Prohibitions

In Greco-Roman wrestling, it is forbidden to grasp the opponent below the belt line and to squeeze him with
the legs. All pushing, pressing or ‘lifting’ by means of contact with the legs on any part of the body of the
opponent is also strictly forbidden.

In  Greco-Roman  wrestling,  if  the  offensive  wrestler  in  the  execution  of  a  manoeuvre  inadvertently  makes
contact or blocks with his legs, the referee shall:
- On the 1st offense, stop the match and warn the guilty wrestler.
- On the 2nd offense, the guilty wrestler's opponent shall be awarded 1 point and the guilty wrestler
shall receive a caution.

In Greco-Roman wrestling, if a defensive wrestler commits  a leg foul, the referee shall:
- stop the match and award the guilty wrestler's opponent 2 points and the guilty wrestler shall receive
a caution.

In freestyle, a scissor-lock with the feet crossed on the head, neck or body is forbidden.


Article 52 – Consequences affecting the Bout

The  illegal  hold  of  the  defensive wrestler  shall  be  stopped  by  the  referee  without  interrupting  the  hold  if
possible. If there is no danger, the referee allows the development of the hold and waits for the result. The
referee then stops the match, awards the points to the attacking wrestler and a caution to the wrestler at
fault.

If the hold begins properly and then becomes illegal, the hold should be evaluated up until the beginning of
the  infraction,  then  the  match  should  be  stopped  and  wrestling  should  be  made  to  continue  in  a  standing
position with the attacking wrestler receiving a verbal warning. If the wrestler attacks again with an illegal
hold, the referee will stop the match, give a caution (0) to the wrestler at fault and one point to his opponent.

In all cases, in the event of any willful butting with the head or any other brutality, the wrestler at fault may
be  eliminated  immediately  from  the  bout  by  a  unanimous  decision  of  the  officiating  team and  disqualified
from the competition. The offending wrestler will receive a red card.  The athlete will be and placed last with
a “DSQ” with the name.





## 39

## CHAPTER 10 – THE PROTEST


## Article 53 – The Protest

No protest after the end of a match or any appeal before CAS or any other jurisdiction against a decision made
by the refereeing body may be lodged. Under no circumstances may the result of a match be modified after
victory has been declared on the mat.

If  the  UWW  President  or  the  responsible  person  for  refereeing  notes  that  the  refereeing  body  have  abused
their  power  to  modify  a  match  result,  they  can  examine  the  video  and,  with  the  agreement  of  the  UWW
Bureau,  sanction  those  responsible  as  laid  down  in  the  provisions  of  the  Regulations  for  International
## Refereeing Body.


## CHAPTER 11 – MEDICAL


## Article 54 – Medical Service

The organizer of the competition in question is obliged to provide a medical service responsible for conducting
medical examinations prior to the weigh-in and give medical control during the bouts. The medical service,
which is required to operate throughout the competition, is under the authority of the UWW doctor in charge.
The medical requirements are described in ad hoc rules.

Before the competitors weigh in, the doctors shall examine the athletes and evaluate their state of health. If
a competitor is considered to be in poor health or in a condition that is dangerous to himself or to his opponent,
he shall be excluded from participating in the competition.


Throughout the competitions, and at any time, the medical service must be prepared to intervene in case of
an accident and to decide whether a wrestler is fit to continue the contest. Doctors from the participating
teams are fully authorized to treat their injured wrestlers, but only the coach or a team officer may be present
while treatment is being administered by the doctor. In no case may UWW be held responsible for an injury,
disability, or death of a wrestler.


## Article 55 – Medical Service Interventions

a) The UWW doctor in charge has the right and duty to stop a bout at any time through the mat chairman,
whenever they consider that either competitor is in danger. At first the injury treatment shall be provided by
or  under  the  supervision  of  the  UWW  doctor  only.  In  case  additional support is  needed,  the  doctor  of  the
wrestlers’ team or the wrestler’s coach may be allowed to come to the mat.

b) The UWW doctor may also stop a bout immediately by declaring one of the wrestlers unfit to continue. The
wrestler must never leave the mat, except in the event of a serious injury requiring immediate removal. In
the case of a wrestler being injured, the referee must immediately ask the doctor to intervene; in case no
injury  is  reported  by  the  competition  doctor,  the  referee  must  request  a  sanction  to  the  judge  or  the  mat
chairman.

c) If a wrestler has a visible injury, the doctor will have the time necessary to treat the injury and will decide
if the wrestler can carry on the match or not.

d) A maximum of four minutes will be allocated for each wrestler for the entire duration of the bout to be
treated for a bleeding injury. The consequences of overrunning this allocated time are described under article
## 26.



## 40

e) In the case of any medical dispute, the doctor for the team of the wrestler in question has the right to
intervene in any treatment required, or to give advice on an intervention or decision made by the medical
service. Only the UWW Medical Commission delegate may propose to the officials that the bout be stopped.

f)  In  international  competitions  where  the  UWW  Medical  Commission  is  not  represented,  the  decision  to
interrupt the bout will be taken by the competition doctor in consultation with the UWW delegate or the UWW
nominated referee and the injured wrestler's team doctor.

g) In all cases, the doctor making the decision to prohibit the wrestler from continuing the bout shall be of a
nationality other than that of the wrestler in question or the opponent, and the doctor must not be involved
in the weight class concerned. In case this situation occurs, the decision will be delegated to another doctor
as designated by the delegate referee.

h) All the first aid injuries (not requiring hospitalization) occurring in UWW international competitions are at
the organizer’s costs. The injuries requiring hospitalization are covered by the UWW license, provided the case
has been announced to the insurance company (at the number appearing at the back of the card) the same
day.

i)  If  an  athlete  is  injured  and  can’t  continue  the  bout,  they will  lose  the  match  by  injury.  The  concerned
athlete won’t have to attend the second weigh-in and will be ranked based on the points accumulated up until
the injury. If the injured athlete is ready to compete for the next match, they must receive the approval of
the UWW Doctor.

An injured athlete will have until one hour after the conclusion of the first day of competition for their weight
category to announce the injury to the UWW Doctor. For all the other type of injuries or diseases that occur
out of competition, the concerned athlete will have to attend the weigh-in otherwise he will be eliminated
from the competition and ranked last, without rank.





## CHAPTER 12 – APPLICATION OF THE WRESTLING RULES

The UWW Executive Bureau is the sole decision-making authority concerning any modifications to the above
provisions that are deemed desirable with a view to improving the technical Rules of wrestling.

These Rules have been drawn up bearing in mind all the circulars and information distributed by the UWW.
They contain all the suggestions put forward by the auxiliary bodies and the Bureau which were accepted by
the UWW Congress.

These Rules are the only valid document of their type until the following Congress which will be asked to rule
on all the possible modifications or interpretations decided by the Executive Bureau.

The National Federations must translate this document into their official language.

Every referee at a competition must have access to the most recent version of the UWW rule book.
