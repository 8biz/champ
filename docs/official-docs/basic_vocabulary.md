## BASIC VOCABULARY


Every member of the refereeing body must be perfectly familiar with and apply the vocabulary set out
below. This vocabulary constitutes the official means of communication between members.

## SALUT
The wrestlers must greet each other.

## START
The  invitation  to  the  wrestlers  standing  at  opposite  corners  of  the  mat  to  step  to  the  centre  to  be
examined  and  shake  hands.  After  this,  they  will  return  to  their  respective  corners  and  await  the
referee’s whistle calling on them to begin wrestling.

## CONTACT
The  referee  calls  upon  the  wrestler  to  place  both  his  hands  on  the  back  of  his  opponent,  who  is
underneath on the ground. Wrestlers in the standing postition must assume « body-to-body » contact.

## OPEN
The wrestler must alter his position and adopt more open wrestling tactics.

## DAWAI
The referee encourages the wrestlers to wrestle more actively.

## ATTENTION
The referee warns the passive wrestler before requesting a caution for refusal to assume the correct
« par terre » position.

## ACTION
The wrestler must execute the hold that he has initiated.

## HEAD UP
The wrestler must raise his head. This order is given by the referee in the case of repeated attacks by
a wrestler who thrusts his head forward.

## LEG
The wrestler has committed a leg error (Greco-Roman)

## POSITION
Initial position of the wrestlers on the ground (or in ordered contact in Greco-Roman wrestling), before
the referee blows his whistle.

## A TERRE

reminds the wrestlers not to flee the mat.

## DANGER
The danger position.

## FAULT
An illegal hold or violation of the technical rules.

## STOP
Stopping of the bout.



## ZONE
This word must be announced in a loud voice if the wrestlers enter the red zone.

## CONTINUE
The bout must be resumed upon this order by the referee. The referee also uses this word to have the
wrestling  continued if  the  wrestlers  stop  due to  confusion  and look  at  him  as if  they  are  asking  for an
explanation.

When one of the wrestlers stops wrestling, intentionally or because of injury or any other reason, the
referee will use this expression to ask the timekeeper to stop his watch.

## UP
The bout must be resumed in the standing position.

## INTERVENTION
The judge, referee, or mat chairman call for intervention.

## OUT
A hold applied outside the mat.

## OK
The hold is valid (legal, correct). If the judge and mat chairman are sitting in a position that does not
allow them to follow closely what is taking place on the opposite side, the referee must raise his arm to
indicate  whether  the  hold  at  the  edge  of  the  mat  was  executed  within  the  boundaries  of  the  mat  or
outside.

## NON
This word is used to indicate that an action is not valid and is consequently void.

## TOUCHE
This  word  is  used  to  indicate  that  the  wrestler  is beaten  by  a  « fall ».  For  a  fall,  the  referee  himself
says « touche », strikes the mat with his hand, and blows his whistle to indicate the end of the bout.
